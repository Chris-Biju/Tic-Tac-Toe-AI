# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

This was another final project I had to make for a python course I was taking. The AI doesn't use actual machine learning, but rather maeks moves using a lot of if statements to check for ertain conditions. 
This is a slightly more advanced version where the computer will try to check for and defend against forks.
